During the last 5 years, the possibility of using physical covert channels to communicate with air-gapped 
information systems has been widely investigated, the main idea being the instrumentation of software or 
hardware components in order to code information on a shared physical medium. In complement, logical covert 
channels in communication protocols have been intensively studied for several decades, mostly relying on 
unused or reserved fields in frames at logical layers or on the instrumentation of timings and state transitions 
in the target protocols. Interestingly, the exploitation of physical layer characteristics of legitimate 
transmissions as covert channels seems to have been underestimated. More recently, an approach was proposed 
to superimpose two different protocols, one ASK-based and one PSK-based, within the same transmitted PHY frames, 
thus illustrating the possibility of covert channels using so-called polyglot signals. 

In this study, we decided to focus on the possibility of using a compromised radiofrequency transceiver in order 
to create a covert channel on the physical layer while preserving a legitimate communication. To this end, we 
considered a classical QPSK transmission system on which a covert communication was implemented by modulating 
the legitimate (modulated) signal. Several modulation schemes were formalized showing that covert channels 
based on polyglot signals are not restricted to the use of complementary carrier characteristics (e.g. amplitude 
for channel 1 and phase for channel 2). For each attack model, a specific receiver has been designed. 
Finally, we will show that the detection of this kind of RF covert channel, which is not possible with a classical 
receiver, can be achieved by monitoring some simple RF characteristics with state-of-the-art signal processing algorithms.
