VENTRILOCK: EXPLORING VOICE-BASED AUTHENTICATION SYSTEMS
WITH 
CHAOUKI KASMI AND JOSÃ‰ LOPES ESTEVES


Voice interfaces are becoming one of the main ways to interact with information systems and especially with IoTs 
and smartphones. During the past few years, several security researchers have proposed new ways of exploiting 
this UI to gain control, mostly remotely, on electronic devices by issuing unauthorized voice commands. Among 
the possible countermeasures to further secure this interface, the speaker authentication seems to be the most deployed. 
However, this biometric authentication method raises technical challenges in order to be both efficient and user friendly.

In this study, a black box approach for discovering the speaker authentication boundaries will be proposed. 
To perform such a task, we implemented several signal processing algorithms to modify original voice signals 
and test them with regards to the targeted voice-based authentication systems. Widely deployed implementations 
will be assessed so as to determine which characteristics of the voice signal are considered by the authentication 
engines and how easily they could be circumvented. Finally, we will discuss the capabilities needed to be able to 
spoof a legit voice signal fully synthetized to by-pass an authentication engine to gain access to the targeted device.
