Random number generation is a critical issue in most cryptographic applications. Random numbers are used 
as confidential keys, but also as initialization vectors, challenges, nonces and masks in side channel attack 
countermeasures. For this reason, a security flaw in random number generation has a direct impact on the 
security of the whole cryptographic system. Contrary to generators used for Monte Carlo simulations, those 
designed for cryptography must also generate unpredictable random numbers. The vulnerability of TRNGs to 
non-invasive attacks has been recently highlighted Our paper presents a contactless attack on a TERO based 
TRNGs using electromagnetic waves. 

Experiments show that a global exposure of the tested FPGAâ€™s to parasitic electromagnetic fields has an 
impact on the quality of the generated randomness. More precisely, the Hamming  weight of the generated 
random numbers were processed in real-time during the experiments in order to detect and correlate the 
abnormal behaviour of the TRNG to the parasitic signal.
