Air gaps are generally considered to be a very efficient information security protection. However, this technique 
also showed limitations, involving finding covert channels for bridging the air gap. Interestingly, recent publications 
have pointed out that a smart use of the intentional electromagnetic interferences introduced new threats for information 
security. 

In this paper, an innovative way for remotely communicating with a malware installed on a computer by involving 
the induced perturbations is discussed leading to the design of a new air gap bridging covert channel.
