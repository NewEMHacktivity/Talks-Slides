During the last decade, classical televisions have experienced the same evolution as computers and feature phones by 
integrating new capabilities. Reading emails, installing applications, surfing the web are now common usages of so-called
Smart TVs. With new services and communication interfaces come new interests from IT security researchers. Multiple studies
dealing with security and privacy issues on a large number of models have been released. Since 2013, the RF signal 
broadcasting digital television contents has been shown as a new attack vector, using interactive applications being received 
through the radiocommunication interface. 

In this paper, the compounds of a DVB-T stream as well as the mechanism of interactive multimedia applications are presented. 
A recent extension of those standards designed to mitigate the interactive applications attack vector has been published in 
early 2017 that will be discussed with regards to weaknesses uncovered during our experimentations. Furthermore, several 
shortcomings of this specification will be discussed listing possible efficient countermeasures for each of them.
