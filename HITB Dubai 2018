HbbTV - Hacking into Broadband and Broadcast TV Systems
By
Chaouki KASMI, Thomas SABONO, Pierre BARRE

Many papers have highlighted critical security issues introduced by Smart TVs and the Hybrid Broadcast and 
Broadband TV protocol enclosed in DVB-T. From privacy issue to full take-over, it has been shown that Smart 
TVs introduce new attack vectors in home networks. In order to better understand and prevent an outsider compromising 
the network entering through the TV, a testbed is highly required for both wireless interfaces (DVB-T, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) 
and the network interface (RJ45). 

In this talk, we explain how we used available tools to design and build a quick and 
dirty testbed for assessing efficiently the security of Smart TVs. As an additional outcome, we will present the 
vulnerabilities uncovered for an Android-based Smart TV.

The following payloads have been tested against specific targets leading to the discovery of 0 days:

Outdated browser full of public vulnerabilities
Denial-of-Service attacks against browser/TV
Miner spreading for cryptocurrency
Malicious MP4 files exploiting vulnerabilities
Fake news spreading
Fake crypto locker spreading
Using XMLHTTP requests/Websockets as relay in order to attack daemons running inside the TV
Using XMLHTTP requests/Websockets as relay in order to target devices located in the LAN(routers, NAS)
Using the Smart TV to participate in a DDoS attack
Using the Smart TV as a relay to Voice-enabled assistant devices (Amazon Echo, Google Homeâ€¦)
SDT Parsing
